1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

    - `describe` is a wrapper for your tests while `it` is ththe actual test. You would want to enclose all test pertaining to a certain function inside a `describe` to keep your tests more organized

1. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

    - Thinking about what the functionality of a unit should be and creating tests for those things before creating the functionality. It makes sense in theory for larger scale applications; the cost of approaching it that way seems to be exponential as the application grows as there seem to me an infinite things that you could test for. I would think that the developer would be thinking about those things anyway as they are developing the functionality in the first place.

1. Mention three types of automated tests.

    - Unit Test, Integration Test, and End to End
